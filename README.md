Projects for Data Applications >> DA-6813

This repositry contains 2 projects from Data Applications DA-6813 with Professor David Han (Donghoon Han) >> An invaluable source in my Data Science education.

The first project is predicting video game success (in the US, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world). The data was obtained from Kaggle. We used several methods to attempt to predict success (what we gauged success as anything over $5 million in sales), and created that variable called "success" >> The methods include: Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  Our team name was "The Super Mario Bros". The files for this project consist of:
   The power point: DA6813SuperMarioBros_FinalPP.pptx >>
   The analysis: Predict_Global_Success.Rmd >>
   Customer Segmentation: vg_cust_seg.Rmd >>
   The Data: Video_Game_Sales_as_of_Jan_2017.csv >>
   The Final Paper: Video_Game_Analysis_Final.docx >>
 The team consisted of: Mike Mahoney and Nathan Shepherd

The second project was predicitng Cryptocurrencies (including: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Maker, Dogecoin and Tether). We used the GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model, and used anywhere from 3 to 7 days to predict the next 5 day's corresponding closing price. We originally obtained the data from Kaggle, but later decided to scrape the data directly from wwww.coinmarketcap.com >> for my acurate and timely data. The team name for the project was "The Roadrunners of Wall St". THe files for this project consist of:
  The power point: final_presentation.pptx >>
  The analysis: crypto_currency.Rmd >>
  A file that cleans up the scraped data: Cryp_Web_Scrape_Clean_up.Rmd >>
  Code used to scrape: crypto_scrape.py >>
  The Final Pape: Crypto_Final_paper.docx >>
  Several Data Files >>
    Crypto_Scraped_Data.csv,
    Bitcoin_Scrape.csv,
    Ripple_Scrape.csv >>
  The team consisted of: Mike Mahoney and Surendra Thapa
